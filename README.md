# Supermarket Sweep
An algorithm written for my Data-structures and Algorithms technical report course work.  

## Scenario
We all hate queueing, but understanding and simulating queues lets shops get better at managing customer flows and satisfaction. Tesco Express in Quigley are looking to simulate the queues for their store which has 3 standard checkouts and an express checkout for 10 items or less in a basket. Customers will join the queue where the current user in front of them has the lowest number of items in their trolley to save time. Create a simulation of this system and populate it with customers and an adaptive queueing system for new customers. Ensure that the system is flexible enough to be translated to the much larger Tesco Metro stores across the country. You can develop this case study in many different ways to make it more realistic.
